## 💰 MyAirdrop

MyAirdrop is a web application that helps users efficiently manage their airdrops. With MyAirdrop, users can input their wallets, track the airdrops they participate in, and manage multiple wallets used for airdrops.

The concept applied is Smart Airdrop Management—optimizing airdrop opportunities with better organization. This feature helps users avoid missing rewards, ensure the correct wallet usage, and save time in managing various airdrops.

In short: MyAirdrop is not just a tracker but a smart solution to maximize the benefits of the airdrops you participate in. 🚀
